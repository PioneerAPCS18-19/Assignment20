# Assignment 20

Some perfect squares have unique mathematical properties. For example, 36 is:

1. A perfect square 
2. The sum of the integers 1 to 8 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36)

A number having both of these properties, being a perfect square and equal to the sum of consecutive integers beginning with 1, is sometimes referred to as a "magic square."

1 and 36 are the first two magic squares and the next one after 36 is 1225:

1. 35\*35 = 1225
2. 1225 = sum of 1 to 49

## Specifications

* Only one class is needed (with a `main` method and the method `printMagicSquares`, no constructor needed), where the `printMagicSquares` method prints the first n magic squares (see the specifications for the method below).

```
    // pre: n > 0
    // post: the first n magic squares have been printed 
    //      (with squared number and integer sum indicated)
    //      Ex: 36 (1 to 8)
    public static void printMagicSquares(int n)
```

* You should only be checking positive integers, so have your program reject invalid inputs.

* Let the users keep using the program as many times as they would like.

### Hints

* You will probably need to use both a `while` and `for` loop in your `printMagicSquares` method.

* I have seen two ways to accomplish this. One method is slow and one is fast (for n = 6, slow method takes about 6.5 min and fast method takes 0.5 s).

* I would recommend using `long` instead of `int` if you want to test big numbers (max value of `int` is 2,147,483,647 and max value of `long` is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807).

### Sample Output

```
Print the first n magic squares: 4
1 (1 to 1)
36 (1 to 8)
1225 (1 to 49)
41616 (1 to 288)
```

```

```

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.
